First order
===========

* Inherit FileParser class from Source class.
* Check Sync class timing
* CPUMeter may not work in some cases??? See message from SBN 02.04.2004
* clev, slev, lfelev mixing coefs locking
* ac3 encoder test: what is 'strange sample'?
* ac3dec: add SPDIF output
* AudioDecoder SPDIF test: add MPA, DTS, PES/AC3, PES/MPA, PES/DTS
* New: out-of-bounds test for filters (update PCM passthrough test)
* New: Test: correct filter timstamp passthrough

Tests
=====
* New: MPAParser test
* New: FileParser test

Think about
===========
* think about: cross-platform time measurement (look for liba52 for reference)
* think about: plugin interface
  (main problem is how to set external filter's parameters and UI)
* think about: optimal dynamic range compressor based on gathered statistics
  (after Loudness histogram filter)

Other
=====
* pes_demux: add more statistics during processing
* mpa_iso: add option to disable dithering (for testing purposes)
* New: decoder & processor .dll
* New: decoder & processor .lib
* New: platform-independent cpu usage interface 
       (to make utils to work in non-win32 environment)
* Modify AC3Enc to use sample_t
* New FFT for AC3 encoder
* remove performance-measure compile options from release builds
  and make special performance-measure builds
* Rename a52dec project and think about to make performance tests
?* Add filter counterpart for parser classes?
