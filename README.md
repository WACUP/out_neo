# out_neo
This is a modified release of the out_mixer Winamp plug-in from https://sourceforge.net/projects/winampmatrixmix/ which allows for up/down-mixing audio (e.g. 2.1 to 5.1). The changes are aimed at improving the plug-in integration with the requirements of being a bundled WACUP plug-in &amp; related output plug-in api changes.
